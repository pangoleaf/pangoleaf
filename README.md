# pangoleaf

Aspiring developer, interested in contributing to open source projects.

Using this page to store small projects and training exercises for now, of varying levels of complexity and usefulness. Anything web-based can be accessed via https://pangoleaf.github.io.

Will be working on something a bit more fleshed out once I've got a front end JS framework under my belt.
